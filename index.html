                MOVIE MANAGEMENT AND RECOMMENDATION USING MOOD ANALYZER
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-info">
                There exists a lack of user privacy and slow movie selection process for users upon searching for the next movie and the recommendation provided by the server in conventional websites. The slow movie selection process leads users to waste most of their free time in just searching for the right taste in movie. To solve this problem, I with my team members have proposed a method to give recommendations to by asking the user’s current mood not by searching for their past history, thus ensuring that user’s needs are met with minimal problems.In this project we have built a website through basic building elements of Frontend (HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript), Django as the framework for connecting to the SQL*Plus database and using the elements of Anaconda and other Python libraries to efficiently deduce the next movie for the user through Natural Language Processing.We have provided a very basic version for implementing the same through using the RESTful API to apply the queryin the Machine Learning model and predict the results through the genre and tag of every movie.

            USER LEVEL THREAD LIBRARY
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-info1">
            The goal of this project is to implement a basic thread system for Linux. The goal of a thread subsystem is to provide applications that want to use threads a set of library functions (an interface) that the application can use to create and start new threads, terminate threads, or manipulate threads in different ways.We will implement a cooperative User Level Thread (ULT) library for Linux that can replace the default PThreads library.Cooperative user level threading is conceptually similar to a concept known as co-routines(Co-routines are general control structures where flow control is cooperatively passed between two different routines 
            without returning), in which a programming language provides a facility for switching execution between different contexts, each of which has its own independent stack.Cooperative threading is fundamentally different than the pre-emptive threading done by many modern operating systems in that every thread must yield in order for another thread to be scheduled. The goal of a thread subsystem is to provide applications that want to use threads a set of library functions (an interface) that the application can use to create and start new threads, terminate threads, or manipulate threads in different ways. The most well-known and
            wide-spread standard that defines the interface for threads on Unix-style operating systems is called POSIX threads (or pthreads). The pthreads interface defines a set of functions, a few of which we want to implement for this project.Of course, there are different ways in which the pthreads interface can be realized, and systems have implemented a pthreads subsystem both in the OS
            kernel and in user mode. For this project, I have implemented a few pthreads functions in user mode (as a library) on Linux.

            Aerodrome and Airline Management System
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-info1">
            The project is based on the traffic that is produced in an airport
which involves the arrival of airplanes, the boarding of passengers,
and the departure of the airplane.
This involves the number of runways available in a particular airport
along with the number of gates available for the passengers to board
the airplanes from.
The project has also covered the reservation that one does which involves
a few hours when a person can board the flight and which also
includes the domestic and international boarding within a few stops
available.
The runway works in a manner such that the flights that arrive first
are give priority in the queue and are arranged in such a manner.
The project has tried to tackle the small problems which generally go
unnoticed like passenger travel time , air-craft wait time and etc, we
have tried to implement algorithms to solve the problems and have
incorporated various data structures.
